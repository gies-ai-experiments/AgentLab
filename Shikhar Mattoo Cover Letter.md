Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the AI Agent Systems Engineer position at AgentLab. With over three years of experience in developing and deploying robust applications using .NET, Python, and cloud platforms, coupled with my academic pursuit of a Master’s in Technology Management at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I am excited about contributing to AgentLab’s mission of building a multi-agent AI framework.

At Infosys, I led a team of five developers to architect and enhance .NET Core applications, achieving a 20% performance boost and 99.9% system uptime across multiple financial risk platforms. I also engineered Azure CI/CD pipelines and automated Jenkins workflows to streamline delivery processes and improve reliability. My background includes strong experience with REST APIs, SQL Server, and concurrent programming patterns which is critical to the orchestration of multi-agent systems like yours.

I am particularly enthusiastic about working on the next phase of AgentLab’s evolution, including real-world data validation, vector-based memory integration, and intelligent agent specialization. The opportunity to shape an AI system that integrates creativity, logic, and collaboration deeply aligns with both my technical strengths and passion for innovation.

I am eager to expand my knowledge in multi-agent systems and AI frameworks, and this role presents a valuable opportunity for hands-on learning and growth. Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,
