5. **Prompt Engineer Agent**: Generates optimized prompts for app creation

## Next Phase Development Goals

- Enhance agent specialization and capabilities
- Implement more robust validation with real-world data sources
- Improve idea scoring and ranking algorithms
- Add memory/vector database for persistent knowledge
- Develop more comprehensive testing framework
- Optimize for production deployment
- Expand to additional use cases beyond product ideation

## Qualifications

- Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, AI, or related field
- Demonstrated experience building complex software systems
- Strong problem-solving and analytical skills
- Excellent communication abilities and teamwork orientation

## Preferred Skills

- Experience with Google Cloud Platform
- Knowledge of NLP techniques and transformers
- Familiarity with vector databases and embedding models
- Understanding of product development processes
- Experience with human-in-the-loop AI systems
- Background in creativity tools or idea generation systems

## Payment

- $20/hour 
- 10 hours per week commitment

## Duration

- Start date: May 25, 2025
- End Date : June 30, 2025
