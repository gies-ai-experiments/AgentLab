# Cover Letter – AI Agent Systems Engineer Application

Hi AgentLab Team,

I’m Niraj Patil — a mechanical engineer turned systems builder, currently pursuing my MS in Technology Management at UIUC. Over the past year, I’ve gone all-in on building **data-intensive, intelligence-driven systems** that blend AI, software engineering, and product execution.

What you’re building at AgentLab deeply resonates with me. I’ve worked on:

- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Built and simulated a **market-making bot framework** using RLlib + LSTM-based price prediction.
- **LLM + Prompt Engineering**: Working on a real-time **insider trading analysis system** that integrates structured scraping, prompt chaining, and explanation generation (Streamlit + OpenAI).
- **System Design & Deployment**: Designed full-stack pipelines for fraud detection and ML stock prediction — API-based ingestion, model orchestration, and scheduling with Docker + AWS.
- **Product & Strategy**: As a Senior Consultant at FACES, I worked directly with AI startups on go-to-market, data architecture, and real-time experimentation.

What excites me about AgentLab is not just the architecture — it’s the *purpose* of crafting intelligent agents that don’t just respond, but **collaborate**. I want to help enhance your agent specialization logic, improve workflow orchestration, and push this system toward production-grade robustness.

You’ll find in me a builder who thrives at the edge of software, intelligence, and user-centered design. I’d love to bring this energy into your mission.

Thank you for the opportunity,  
**Niraj Patil**
